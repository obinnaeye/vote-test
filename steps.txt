If user, add user advantages, else send normal stuffs
Routes that need special advantages are
    poll ... add options, create poll, delete poll, logout, profile
    home ... logout, new poll, my polls, profile

show 404.html page when page does not exist (see pollLinkPage in pollController.server.js)

adding a new poll should flash a success message or error message
