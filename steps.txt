If user, add user advantages, else send normal stuffs
Routes that need special advantages are
    poll ... add options, create poll, delete poll, logout, profile
    home ... logout, new poll, my polls, profile

show 404.html page when page does not exist

adding a new poll should flash a success message or error message

//delete poll should be in the profile
//deal with warning and ensure they are hidden when correct parameters are entered
