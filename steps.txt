Authenticate the api, and return user info to display on view
If user, add user advantages, else send normal stuffs
Routes that need special advantages are
    poll ... add options, create poll, delete poll, logout, profile
    home ... logout, new poll, my polls, profile

show 404.html page when page does not exist (see pollLinkPage in pollController.server.js)

adding a new poll should flash a success message or error message

//nav buttons
//deal with warning and ensure they are hidden when correct parameters are entered
//handle lengths of text in display eg description title options
//remember un-auth poll.html
//add poll link to view
//delete sesion once done
//tidy positioning for new option and create poll
//change value from "new" to "......"
